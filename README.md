## BlogChain - A Decentralised Blogging Platform

This work proposes a Write-to-Earn decentralised application called BlogChain to create aligned incentives for both writers and readers. The decentralised nature of blockchain technology provides a secure and transparent platform. Writers can publish their work and receive rewards for their efforts. The use of BlogChain NFTs provides a mechanism for writers to prove ownership of their work. It enables readers to support their favourite writers through tipping. The use of a native BLOG cryptocurrency creates an ecosystem for the growth of readers and writers.

Code for the front-end is available here: https://github.com/AryanSai/BlogChain-FrontEnd
